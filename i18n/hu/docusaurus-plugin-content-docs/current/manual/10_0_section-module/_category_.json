    "description": "Consteel's cross-sections related functionality have been integrated into a separate yet fully integrated module, the **Section Module** (csSection). This module collects all the tools relate to the creation, property calculation, stress analysis, and standard design of a cross-section. Two parallel cross-sectional modeling works side by side in Consteel: the _**General Solid Section**_ (GSS) is an accurate, finite element-based surface model for any type of cross-section; the _**Elastic Plate Segment**_ (EPS) is a section model made of thin plate segments, especially for steel sections. Steel standard design formulas can be easily solved based on the EPS model, including the actual Class 4 effective cross-section produced based on the cross-sectional internal forces determined during structural analysis."
