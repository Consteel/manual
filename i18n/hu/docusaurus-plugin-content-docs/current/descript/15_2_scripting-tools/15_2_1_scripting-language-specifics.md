# Scripting language specifics

Descript is **not case-sensitive**, in other words, it is not differentiating between uppercase (capital) and lowercase letters.

In Descript, command parameters are separated with spaces. Because of this, if any parameter input contains a space, then the use of apostrophes at the beginning and end of the input ("...") are needed to force Descript to consider the content between the apostrophes as one entry.
