    "description": "The Fire design process is an integrated part of the _ConSteel_ automated and efficient design process. In case of fire design situation _ConSteel_ automatically uses and applies propel formulas of EuroCode for steel elements. General information about the design functionalities can be found in the Standard design chapter.This chapter describes the workflow of the Fire design in_**ConSteel**_and highlights the differences compared to the general rules. Depending on the designed fire protection solution, the structure can be unprotected or protected, in the latter case, the fire protection can be passive (insulation) or reactive (intumescent painting). The calculation can be performed with material properties at elevated or room temperature. In the case of elevated temperature analysis, the indirect effects of thermal expansion can also be considered separately.The required code checks of the different types of steel structural components – cross sections, members – can be conveniently evaluated based on the following standard:EN 1993-1-2: General rules. Structural fire design"
