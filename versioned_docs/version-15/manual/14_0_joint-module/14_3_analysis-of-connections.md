# Analysis of connections

All the analysis in csJoint module is based on the standard procedures of Eurocode 3 Part 1-8, these procedures are almost entirely covered by the module. For the different types of connections the following analyses are performed:

- Moment connections:

  - Moment resistance based on the plastic tension components of the individual or grouped bolt rows and compression components including the effect of axial load
  - Shear resistance of the bolts in combined shear and tension
  - Bearing resistance of plates
  - Web and flange weld resistance and capacity to the applied load, the section strength, or the appropriate component
  - Initial and secant stiffness based on the tension and compression components and applied moment

- Shear connections:

  - Shear resistance of bolts and plates
  - Bearing resistance of plates
  - Block tearing resistance of plates
  - Weld resistance and capacity to the applied load or section strength

- Hollow section connections:

  - Chord face failure, web failure, shear failure, and punching shear failure
  - Brace failure
  - Local buckling of the members
