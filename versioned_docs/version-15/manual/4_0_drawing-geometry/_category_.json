Among the basic CAD drawing, modifying, and moving functionality advanced snap options make the modeling efficient. All the CAD functionality is placed on the Geometry tab, the further view, select and snap options are on the side and status bar. Additionally, all the relevant modeling functions are placed on the dialogues of structural members, supports, and loads."
