# Surface members

Plane surface members with uniform thickness can be modelled. Two options are available for surface member modelling: the arbitrary shaped and positioned _plate member (_![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-cmd_create_plate.png)_)_; and the vertical and square _wall member (_![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-cmd_create_wall.png)_)_. The latter one is a modelling aid for the frequently used definition of walls since only the reference base line and the two height values should be defined.

In the **_Plate_** and **_Wall_** definition panels the drawing functions are collected in order to create the plate with the desired shape. Arbitrarily shaped holes can be defined in existing plate members. Three parameters can be set: the thickness, the material and the finite element size of the surface member. The finite element size is an approximate target maximum size for the finite element mesh used for the calculation of surface members.

### Plate reinforcement

In case of concrete **_Plates_**, reinforcements can be added to the model at the reinforcement dropdown menu, or by clicking on the (â€¦) button. Diameters, covering and material can be set on the **_Reinforcement_** dialogue:
