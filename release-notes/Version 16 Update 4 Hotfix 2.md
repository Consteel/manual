_**Bug fixes:**_

-Fixed load combinations crash.

-Crash in case of composite column definition fixed.

-Crash when observing seismic analysis results has been fixed. 

-Seismic result documentation has been corrected to a better layout. 

-The descript dialog box has been corrected. 

-Crash due to tapered box section has been repaired. 

-Division of selected objects has been corrected for haunches.

-Bug fixed regarding user defined standard creation and delete. 

-Crash when opening some files created with earlier version has been fixed.  

-Geometrical data of American W profiles has been changed. 
-Design crash is fixed. 

-Crash related to documentation export is fixed. 

-Handling of invalid predescribed support displacement has been improved. 

-Copy of shear field corrected. 

-Pure resistance utilization visualization problem has been solved. Design grid and Section module will display the same utilization now. 

-Distribution of surface load from API has been corrected.

-Correction in documentation regarding decimal separator. 

-Bug in buckling sensitivity has been fixed. 

-Seismic results combinations remains the selected. 

-Seismic CQC directions in results are fixed. 

-Descripts fixed: 3D hall with tapered frames, Gable wall duopitch, Gable wall monopitch, Laced column, Battened column

-Bug of imperfection load visualization has been fixed. 

-Problems with 0 length lines have been fixed. 

-Distribution of wind friction loads fixed.

_**Changes:**_

-Welded I section new default parameter. 

-In case of frame corner on a tapered member, the height of the first small finite element after the frame corner will now be equal to the endheight and not the average height of the first element. 

-Hide and submodel view icons appear now also on the auto portion window. 

-‘The actions can be favorable….’ checkbox is checked on by default from now for every load case that is not in permanent load group. 

_**Improvements:**_

-Danish Eurocode National Annex implemented in the new version. 

-IDEA 24 interface has been implemented

-Google Analytics connection reintroduced to gain usage statistics. 

-Documentation improvement for the SLS verifications and export. 

-Model diagnostics were improved: the software now doesn’t identify bar members connected to plates at both ends as unsupported model parts. 

-Improvements were made for handling corrupted model files at file open. 

-Buckling sensitivity colors improvement, red color.

-Model visualization improved in case of tab changes. (The position of the structure on the screen has modified earlier when changing from Analysis tab to Structural members because of the result table. The position remains the same now.) 

 -Visualization of surface loads on plates is improved.
