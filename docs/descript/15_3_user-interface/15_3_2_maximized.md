<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-11-Screenshot-2022.03.23.-14_05_08.png) In the header on the right there is the button for the watch window. More on that at the [Debugging](https://consteelsoftware.com/manual/descript-cspi/debugging/) page

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Below the header there is the **code input area**. This is where variables, cycles, commands can be defined, and will be executed line-by-line after the Run button is clicked. On the left, code lines are numbered. To the right of the code input area, there is a miniaturized view of the code currently in the editor, which acts as a second scrollbar for easier navigation within the code.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The editor applies different colors for commands, variables etc.. The color coding scheme is the following:

**Code editor features**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Command info box

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If the mouse pointer is placed over a command, a box will appear with basic information about the command. The info box contains the following data:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- Short description of the command
- Syntax of the command (optional parameters are not shown here)
- Link to the user manual page of the command

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":34503,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Auto search

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The editor automatically searches within all the already used variable names and all commands for the text already typed. The search results appear in a box around the cursor. The list of results can be navigated with the arrow buttons and an item can be selected with an Enter.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":34495,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media"} -->

[![](https://consteelsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-13.png)](./img/wp-content-uploads-2022-03-image-13.png)

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Autocomplete + insert

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After an item is selected from the search results, the selected item gets inserted into the editor. There are 3 different type of inserts:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->

- **Variable name  
  **Completes the variable name
- **Field insert (for, if)**  
  Inserts a multi-line code segment with the empty structure of the selected item
- **Command**  
  Completes the command, and if there are required parameters for the command then inserts some text for the parameters and enters the parameter definition mode. In this mode parameters can be easily defined. Just type the desired parameter value then switch between parameters with Tab (forward) and Shift+Tab (backward). Exit parameter definition mode with Esc.
