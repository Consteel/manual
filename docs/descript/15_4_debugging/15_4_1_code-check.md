<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} -->

**Warning**: The code line that produces the warning is underlined with yellow. The warning message states the reason for the warning. Warnings do not prevent the code from running properly.

Warning messages are displayed if the "warnings" text is clicked on the right side, or if the mouse pointer is placed over the underlined row.
