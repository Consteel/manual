# Analysis

During the finite element generation _**ConSteel**_ calculates the steel temperature and the reduced modulus of elasticity. These values can be viewed in the **Finite element** tab by selecting the appropriate load case.

The analysis for the fire load combinations are performed in global level. Therefore the calculated deformations and internal forces possibly include the effect of the expansion and decreased elasticity modulus of those members which are subjected to fire.
