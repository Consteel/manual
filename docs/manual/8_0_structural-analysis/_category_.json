    "description": "The analysis of the structural model can be the most “black box” type phase of the design process for the engineer, and additionally, the modern structural standards usually define the appropriate and required analysis type for the used design formula. The ConSteel applies the finite element method for all the calculations using two beam-column element types (traditional 12 DOF Timoshenko and 14 DOF thin-walled including warping of the section) and two shell elements (triangle and quadrilateral). The great variety of calculation possibilities includes first and complete second-order (not only P-d effect) analysis; flexural-, torsional-, and lateral-torsional buckling solutions; local buckling analysis of slender steel members built from shell elements; static and dynamic eigenvalue analysis and earthquake calculation based on elastic response spectrum and modal analysis. The exceptionally fast and robust equation solvers yield optimal calculation time even for unusually huge models. The functionalities connected with the structural analysis are placed on two tabs: the **Finite element** and Analysis tab. On the** Finite element **tab, mesh generation options are available for surface elements, and the generated finite element model can be viewed. Usually, this step can be skipped since in the first step of the analysis the finite element mesh generation is automatically performed."
