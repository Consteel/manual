# Cloud save and sharing models'

Cloud model save, open and share are new features available from version 15. Your cloud-saved models will accumulate in your personal cloud storage provided by the Steelspace platform. You can quickly view, access, open, or share them directly from Consteel. Your cloud-saved models are always synchronized into the following folder of your local device: C:\\Users(username)\\AppData\\Local\\ConSteel\\CloudModels. The model synchronization costs data bandwidth from your monthly limit. Model synchronization is done during the events of first cloud-save, model sharing, and closing the model, all the other actions are saving the model only to the local device in order not to increase the data traffic within your bandwidth limit. If any synchronization problem happens (the models on the local device and in the cloud are not identical and it is not clear which is the right one) you can choose which model version to continue with.

### Sharing models

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

You can share models saved to the cloud with others. Users who have registered a Consteel account on our website can also view these models in their cloud storage. If someone doesn't have a Consteel account yet, a dashed-lined circle will appear next to their email addresses.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

You can edit on which **platform** you want to share your model. Steelspace only means that the shared model can be accessed on the web browser-based Steelspace platform only. Steelspace is under development at the moment. Steelspace and desktop means that the shared model can be accessed on Steelspace and in Consteel.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

You can edit also which sharing **type** should be available for the model. _Model only_ means that you share only your model file without results. _Model and results_ means that you share your model and the results regarding your model as well.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When you would like to stop sharing a model with someone, just click on the trash bin icon on the right side in line with that user.
