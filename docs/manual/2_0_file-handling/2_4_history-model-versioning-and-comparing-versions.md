# History (model versioning) and comparing versions

In Consteel 16, you can create, view, download, edit and restore previous versions of your models as a new cloud-based service supported by Steelspace. An online connection is required to use the History function as it only works with cloud-saved models. All versioning-related actions cost bandwidth therefore using this service is only limited by the monthly storage limit of your Consteel Community Membership. **So don’t forget to save your model regularly as creating a history item and saving to the cloud are not the same!** The purpose of the History function is to preserve different states of a model that can be important for future modifications or model review.

As an addition to the model history function, we have introduced the compare feature, which allows comparing two versions of the same model. Comparing takes place in Steelspace where you can select easily which versions would you like to compare.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When opening a model in Steelspace you can find the „Compare version” button at the top within the History tab. Clicking the button will start the compare feature and the opened model version becomes automatically one of the selected versions, a hint will appear and you just have to select another version to compare with.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

_Dialog for selecting which versions to compare_

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Starting from the new version, criteria for comparison can be set. Users can select, with the help of dropdown menus, the objects to display status changes on, and the selected objects will be colored in the following manner:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

\- Green for the objects that have been added to the model

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

\- Red for objects that are deleted

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

\- Yellow for the changed objects.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Additionally, more detailed selection can be performed on all the selected objects with the following checkboxes. Here, users can set the criteria after which the comparison has to be done.
