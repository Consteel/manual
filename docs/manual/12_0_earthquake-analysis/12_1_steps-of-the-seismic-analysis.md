# Steps of the seismic analysis

Modal response spectrum based seismic analysis can be performed with the following steps in ConSteel:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->

1. Definition of modal loads/Mass tab

   - Definition of mass cases and mass groups
   - Mass defintion manually on the structure, or by converting existing load cases
   - Mass combination definitions

2. Seismic effect definition/Masses tab

   - Definition of Standard or User defined response spectrum
   - Definition of Seismic effect
   - Setting the analysis method

3. Seismic loadgroup and load combination definition / Loads tab

   - Seismic loadgroup and loadcase creation
   - Assignment of seismic effect to seismic loadcase
   - Definition of considered shapes for the analysis â€“ Only in the case of _Selected modes, linear summation_ analysis method!

4. Analysis / Analysis tab

   - Setting the statical calculation parameters; For the comparision of available analysis types, please check at the _[ Analysis types](../8_0_structural-analysis/8_4_analysis-types.md)_
   - Setting the parameters for Dynamic calculations

5. Design / Global checks and Member checks tab

   - For the available design checks, please go to the comparision of different types at the [Standard design chapter.](../9_0_standard-design/9_1_steel-design.md)
