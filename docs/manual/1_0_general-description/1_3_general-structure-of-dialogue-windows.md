# General structure of dialogue windows

Several dialogue windows – especially the most important ones on the **Structural members** and **Loads **tabs – show the same structure in order to make the orientation in the labyrinth of tools and functions easy. The usual parts of these dialogues are described below:

<!-- wp:list -->

- \#1 - the method of placement (assign to an element or draw from one point to another)
- \#2 - get parameters from an existing object and use them to create a new object
- \#3 - the coordinate system in which the directions of the object are considered
- \#4 - additional drawing functions if the chosen method of placement is drawing
- \#5 - the parameters of the object are placed in the middle part of the dialog window.
- \#6 - the information field at the bottom gives relevant information for the next step of the placement.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Every icon on the dialog windows has a tooltip with the name of the function. The text will appear when the pointer hovers over the icon.
