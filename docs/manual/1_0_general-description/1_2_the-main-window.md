# The main window

The Consteel window consists of seven separate parts containing different functionalities.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":6857,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"media","className":"is-resized is-style-default"} -->

[![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-Main-window-numbers-1-1024x555.png)](https://Consteelsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Main-window-numbers-1.png)

- The **graphical window** is the area for the 3D structural modeling (#1)
- The **menu** on the top contains some important commands (#2)
- **Tabs** from left to right lead the user through the steps of structural design (#3)
- **Sidebar** on the left contains functions for grids, views, most commonly used transformations, and selections (#4)
- The **csPI editor** pop-up panel is for parametric modeling (#5)
- The **status bar** on the bottom makes the drawing phases easier (#6)
- The **Side Panel** contains the Object and parameter tables and gives always sophisticated information about the model, making fast modifications possible (#7).


<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### The graphical window

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:column {"width":"95%"} -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} -->

The structural model appears always in the graphical window. There are no other window opening options; however, there are lots of viewing possibilities in this single window. The graphical window supports the modeling by the global coordinate system (_GCS_) and a moveable, rotatable, and size adjustable grid. The [_**coordinate system**_](../4_0_drawing-geometry/4_1_coordinate-systems.md) at the left bottom corner denotes always the unchangeable _GCS_; the origin of the [_**user coordinate system (UCS)**_](../4_0_drawing-geometry/4_1_coordinate-systems.md#user-coordinate-system) takes place at the middle point of the grid which is always the plane “XY” of the _UCS_. The following moving possibilities and quick view settings can be used during the structural model manipulation:

- **Move**: push and hold down the middle mouse button or use the four arrow buttons on the keyboard to move the model on the screen
- **Rotate**: hold down the **_Alt_** key and the left mouse button. The center of rotation is always adapting the actual model view
- **Scaling**: spin the middle mouse button forth and back or use the **_+_** and **_-_** buttons on the keyboard or hold down the Alt key and the right mouse button
- **Zoom window**: window drawing by the left mouse button, while pressing **_Shift+Alt_** keys
- **Hotkeys for views**:

  - **Ctrl+1**: Switch to **top view**
  - **Ctrl+2**: Switch to **front view**
  - **Ctrl+3**: Switch to **side view**
  - **Ctrl+4**: Switch to **axonometric view**
  - **Ctrl+5**: Perpendicular to the actual UCS plane
  - **Ctrl+0**: Quick **zoom all**


### The menu


The _Consteel_ menu does not contain many commands since the main functionality is placed to the structured tabs and to the side bars, and the applicability and modeling efficiency does not really need to duplicate the functions. However, six important function groups appear here: [**_File_** ](#file-menu)handling, some [**_Edit_** ](#edit-menu)options (undo-redo), [**_View_** ](#view-menu)and diagnostics, [**_Options_**](#options-menu) for settings (for saving, updating, selecting language, and for model diagnostics), [**_Standards_** ](#standards-menu)for reviewing and defining standard parameters for design and **_[Help](#help-menu)_**.

If **Autosave** is clicked, the program automatically performs a save periodically in accordance with the adjusted number of minutes. If **Backup** is clicked, _Consteel_ creates a backup file _after a manual save is performed_. The backup model file can be used as a normal model by removing the **_.bak_** extension.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

Before the analysis, the program checks the model for possible modeling mistakes. Two different levels of modeling mistakes may occur: errors and warnings.


- **Error:** if the distance between the finite element nodes of 1D or 2D elements is more than 0 but less than the given value, the program sends an error message and shows with red sign the relevant members in the diagnostics window and does not perform the analysis.
- **Warning:** if the distance between the finite element nodes of 1D or 2D elements is more than the defined error level distance but less than the given value here, the program sends a warning message, and shows with a yellow sign the relevant members in the diagnostics window.

From _Consteel 17_ this function belongs to the **Model settings** category, together with the **Diagnostics.**

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} -->

The **Automatic load distribution** can be switched off to increase the speed of modelling. In general, distribution of surface loads to bar members of the **Load Transfer Surfaces** is done automatically by the software and also the redistribution is immediate after any change on the model that indicates it. In case of large models with several LTS's, it can lead to slow model handling. By switching off automatic load distribution for the time of model adjustments, can speed up the process. Please note, that when the function is switched off, the **Distributed Line Loads** will not be valid any more in case of a change of the LTS or the surface load. As a consequence, analysis can not be run in this state of the model. A Diagnostic error will warn you on that. To update the loads according to the new model state, either check in the check-box or click on the Update button appearing with the Diagnostic error.

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The first field is a progress bar showing the progress of the actions.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The next 3 icons on the status bar ( ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar2.png)) determine the interpretation of the manually entered coordinates during drawing/modeling operations. To enter a coordinate value click on the input box or press the corresponding key on the keyboard (“X, Y, Z, L” for the coordinate axis or a length into a direction, or “a, b, L” for polar coordinates). The user can change the interpretation of the manually entered values by clicking on these three icons. Each click changes the state of this switches:

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"editorskit":{"indent":40,"devices":false,"desktop":true,"tablet":true,"mobile":true,"loggedin":true,"loggedout":true,"acf_visibility":"","acf_field":"","acf_condition":"","acf_value":"","migrated":false,"unit_test":false}} -->

Coordinates can be entered in the ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar3.png) **Global** (GCS), or in the ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar4.png) **User** (UCS) coordinate system.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"editorskit":{"indent":40,"devices":false,"desktop":true,"tablet":true,"mobile":true,"loggedin":true,"loggedout":true,"acf_visibility":"","acf_field":"","acf_condition":"","acf_value":"","migrated":false,"unit_test":false}} -->

The entered value can be an ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar5.png) **Absolute** value measured from the origin of the coordinate system or a ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar6.png) **Relative** one measured from the ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-Insertion-point.png) insertion point ( the yellow dot in the model space).

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"editorskit":{"indent":40,"devices":false,"desktop":true,"tablet":true,"mobile":true,"loggedin":true,"loggedout":true,"acf_visibility":"","acf_field":"","acf_condition":"","acf_value":"","migrated":false,"unit_test":false}} -->

Finally, coordinates can be entered in a ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar7.png) **Descartes**, or in a ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar8.png) **Polar** coordinate system.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Even when using the Descartes coordinate system, it is possible to define a point by specifying a direction and a distance as follows. If you have already picked the first point e.g of a new structural beam, while approaching another point with your cursor in the model space, after typing “L” (lowercase), you can enter the length of your beam manually into the L field. By pressing the Enter key the beam will be created with the given length ("L" value) and the direction defined by the two points.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

By moving the slider (![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-slider-v15.png)), the size representation of the objects can be changed. Clicking on it with the right mouse button the sizes can be changed individually by object types. The next four icons ( ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar10.png)) allow the sophisticated visibility adjustment. By approaching any of these icons with the cursor a group of graphic symbols will appear ordered into a matrix shape.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Clicking the first icon on each of these four visibility setting matrix the scope of the settings will be changed between global (![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar11.png)) (valid for all tabs), or valid only for the current tab (![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-status-bar12.png)). Changing this option on any of the 4 visibility matrixes, the selected scope will also change on all the other three accordingly. Changing this scope will also change the visibility between the previously adjusted global and the current tab visibility settings.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

- Snapping the end points of graphical (lines, arcs) and structural (beams, columns) objects
- Switch divide function ON / OFF
  - ON
    - When the Divide snap mode is turned ON, a new field will appear on the status bar. There are 3 options for the divide snap point specification. The user can switch cyclically between them by clicking on the icon before the numeric field.>
      - ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-divide-percentage.png)The percentage of the length of the approached element will be calculated, and from its approached end this length will be measured by the snapping points. Usually, there is a rest distance at the end of the element
      - ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-divide-distance.png)A distance can be specified. This length will be measured by the snapping points from the approached end of the object. Usually, there is a rest distance at the end of the element
      - ![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-6-divide-number.png)The number of divisions can be specified. The created snapping points are the intersection points of subdivided lengths. There is no rest distance at the end of the element

  - OFF: The field of division will disappear from the bottom status bar

- Snapping the intersection points of graphical (lines, circles, arcs) and structural (beams, columns) objects
- Snapping the parallel point to a linear object (Its use is recommended only for smaller models.)
- Snapping edges and line object
- Snapping the lengthened point of a linear object. The system is showing the actual distance of the snapping point in \[mm] from the endpoint of a linear element. The lengthening distance can be set in steps given in the last field of the status bar (see below).
- Snap to points.
- Snap to raster points.
- Snapping point to create a tangent of an Arc / Circle from one point
- Snapping point to create a perpendicular from one point to an object (Line or Arc/Circle )
- Snapping the Center point of Arc / Circle.

For snapping the center of linear elements, you have to use the appropriate settings of snap divided points, see above!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

#### Step field

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The last field of the Status bar is the STEP field. Here the given number in mm is the snapping distance towards the length direction of line and bar elements when the lengthening snapping point is ON.

By default, the Model Content tab contains all the predefined basic object types which can be used to build up a structural model. While modeling, each new object (materials, sections, loads, members, supports etc.) will appear in the tree object structure in the appropriate group. Selecting any of the objects, it will be highlighted (selected) in the model graphic. Multiple selections of objects are possible in this tree. See more in the [**_Selection_**](../3_0_model-view/3_2_selection.md) chapter.

In the case of geometrical or modeling mistakes (like overlapping two or more objects, missing supports, etc..), the _Diagnostic_ window switches ON automatically listing problematic objects in a tree structure.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":7336,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media","className":"is-resized"} -->

[![](https://Consteelsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-2-7-diag-window.png)](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-7-diag-window.png)

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The first type of diagnostic result is the **error** messages appearing in **red** color.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The second type of diagnostic result is **possible errors** in **yellow** color.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

By clicking on any of the object names in the tree structure, and pressing the Select button, the object will be selected and highlighted in the model and the properties of it will be displayed as well in the Object properties window (see below). You can select more objects at the same time by clicking their name while pressing the Shift or Ctrl key or you can select a whole group of objects by clicking on the problem description.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

All selected objects (and sub-object) appear in the table. Selecting different types of objects (e.g. members and supports) the objects will be shown in groups. By expanding any of the groups all of the object's parameters can be seen and modified if possible. In the case of multiple selections, a replacement value ("different") will be displayed for different values. However, the different ones can also be changed. In this case, the new value will be applied to all of the selected objects.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

With the unselect button (![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-2-2-7-unselect.png)) the previously selected object type can be removed from the selection.
