# Results and documentation

The analysis results are displayed in two main forms: a summarized view containing the main resistances, stiffness and capacities; and a detailed view showing the components of the main results which is comprehensive enough to see what are the weakest point of the connections and what type of strengthening would be the most efficient to apply. A joint is calculated for all the loads coming from different places or different combinations, and the dominant place and combination is automatically highlighted. The spectacular documentation shows the detailed geometry of the joint with its connections, and the summarized and detailed results for all cases can be flexibly documented.

The way for creating documentation is the same as in _ConSteel_ main module [see here for more detailed instructions](../13_0_documentation-2/13_1_the-document-tab.md).
