# Rigid body

With this function, you can create a rigid body-like line element in the model. Separate structural members can be linked together with the rigid body.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} -->

The first step is to select the lines, structural elements, or surface element edges that you want to transform into a rigid body, and then click the _**Rigid body**_ (![](./img/wp-content-uploads-2021-04-cmd_rigid.png)) icon on the **_Structural members_** tab. Clicking the **APPLY** button creates the rigid body.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### Modifying rigid body

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"justify"} -->

A rigid body can be modified by selecting it and changing the lines, members, and surface edges selection on the property bar. With the black arrow, previously selected members can be removed from the selection or new members can be added.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
